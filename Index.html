            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am from Blue Springs, Missouri.  I have a BS in Computer Science.  I am currently working towards Software Development for my career.<br>
            My hobbies include gaming, golfing, and programming. <br>
            A few years ago, I remade the classic arcade game Pac-Man from scratch (with the exception of the art). <br>
            I really like the idea of working with video games.  It is interesting to see how a game can be made and what tricks developers use to make a game work.

            <h2>Current Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I really want to get my Pac-Man game up and running and cleaning the code.</li>
                <li>In my Software Development class, we started working on personal projects.  My current one is making Monopoly. <br>
                    In future lessons, I hope to be able to use UI instead of the Terminal</li>
                <li>Future Project.  I want to be able to modify a few existing games.  There are a few games I really want to work on</li>
